Each image is labeled with the digit it represents. This set has been studied so much that it is often called the “hello world” of Machine Learning: whenever people come up with a new classification algorithm they are curious to see how it will perform on MNIST, and anyone who learns Machine Learning tackles this dataset sooner or later.\n",
